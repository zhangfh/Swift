// Advanced Operators

//  Unlike arithmetic operators in C, arithmetic operators in Swift do not overflow by default. Overflow behavior is trapped and reported as an error. To opt in to overflow behavior, use Swift’s second set of arithmetic operators that overflow by default, such as the overflow addition operator (&+). All of these overflow operators begin with an ampersand (&).

// Bitwise Operators
// Bitwise NOT
let initialBits: UInt8 = 0b00001111
let invertedBits = ~initialBits

// Bitwise AND
let firstSixBits: UInt8 = 0b11111100
let lastSixBits:  UInt8 = 0b00111111
let middleFourBits = firstSixBits & lastSixBits

// Bitwise OR
let someBits: UInt8 = 0b10110010
let moreBits: UInt8 = 0b01011110
let combinedBits = someBits | moreBits

// Bitwise XOR
let firstBits: UInt8 = 0b00010100
let otherBits: UInt8 = 0b00000101
let outputBits = firstBits ^ otherBits

// Bitwise Left and Right Shift
let shiftBits: UInt8 = 4
shiftBits << 1
shiftBits << 2
shiftBits << 5
shiftBits << 6
shiftBits
shiftBits >> 2

let pink: UInt32 = 0xCC6699
let redComponent = (pink & 0xFF0000) >> 16
let greenComponent = (pink & 0x00FF00) >> 8
let blueComponent = pink & 0x0000FF

let negativeBits: Int8 = -4
negativeBits << 1
negativeBits << 2
negativeBits << 5
negativeBits << 6
negativeBits >> 2
negativeBits >> 5 // Doesn't overflow

// Overflow Operators
//  Overflow addition (&+)
//  Overflow subtraction (&-)
//  Overflow multiplication (&*)

var potentialOverflow = Int16.max
// potentialOverflow += 1 // This causes an error if it runs

var willOverflow = UInt8.max
willOverflow = willOverflow &+ 1

    // Value Underflow
var unsignedOverflow = UInt8.min
unsignedOverflow = unsignedOverflow &+ 1

unsignedOverflow = UInt8.min
unsignedOverflow = unsignedOverflow &- 1

var signedOverflow = Int8.min
signedOverflow = signedOverflow &- 1


// Precedence and Associativity
//  Operator associativity defines how operators of the same precedence are grouped together (or associated)—either grouped from the left, or grouped from the right. Think of it as meaning “they associate with the expression to their left,” or “they associate with the expression to their right.
2 + 3 * 4 % 5

// * and % have a higher precedence than +.
// * and & have the same precendence as each other but both associate to their left. Think of this as adding implicit parentheses around these parts of the expression, starting from their left: (This explanation seems arbitrary to me. Aparently more info in the Expressions chapter)
