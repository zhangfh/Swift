//  All structures have an automatically-generated memberwise initializer, which you can use to initialize the member properties of new structure instances.

// Structures and Enumerations are Value Types
//  A value type is a type that is copied when it is assigned to a variable or constant, or when it is passed to a function.

// Classes are Reference Types
//  Reference types are not copied when they are assigned to a variable or constant, or when they are passed to a function. Rather than a copy, a reference to the same existing instance is used instead.

}

//  Note that “identical to” (represented by three equals signs, or ===) does not mean the same thing as “equal to” (represented by two equals signs, or ==):

// Pointers
// A Swift constant or variable that refers to an instance of some reference type is similar to a pointer in C, but is not a direct pointer to an address in memory.
