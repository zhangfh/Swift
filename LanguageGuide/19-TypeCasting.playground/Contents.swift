//  Swiftâ€™s type checker is able to deduce that Movie and Song have a common superclass of MediaItem, and so it infers a type of MediaItem[] for the library array:
let library = [
    Movie(name: "Casablanca", director: "Michael Curtiz"),
    Song(name: "Blue Suede Shoes", artist: "ElvisPresley"),
    Movie(name: "Citizen Kane", director: "Orson Welles"),
    Song(name: "The One And Only", artist: "Chesney Hawkes"),
    Song(name: "Never Gonna Give You Up", artist: "Rick Astley")
]
let librarymirror = library.customMirror
librarymirror.subjectType

//  The items stored in library are still Movie and Song instances behind the scenes. However, if you iterate over the contents of this array, the items you receive back are typed as MediaItem, and not as Movie or Song. In order to work with them as their native type, you need to check their type, or downcast them to a different type, as described below.
// Checking Type
var movieCount = 0
var songCount = 0

for item in library {
    if item is Movie {
        movieCount += 1
    } else if item is Song {
        songCount += 1
    }
}

print("Media library contains \(movieCount) movies and \(songCount) songs")


// Downcasting
for item in library {
    if let movie = item as? Movie {
        print("Movie: '\(movie.name)', dir. \(movie.director)")
    } else if let song = item as? Song {
        print("Song: '\(song.name)', by \(song.artist)")
    }
}


// Type Casting for Any and AnyObject
var things = [Any]()

things.append(0)
things.append(0.0)
things.append(42)
things.append(3.1459)
things.append("hello")
things.append((3.0, 5.0))
things.append(Movie(name: "Ghostbusters", director: "Ivan Reitman"))
things.append({ (name: String) -> String in "Hello, \(name)" })

for thing in things {
    switch thing {
    case 0 as Int:
        print("zero as an Int")
    case 0 as Double:
        print("zero as a Double")
    case let someInt as Int:
        print("an integer value of \(someInt)")
    case let someDouble as Double where someDouble > 0:
        print("a positive double value of \(someDouble)")
    case is Double:
        print("some other double value that I don't want to print")
    case let someString as String:
        print("a string value of \"\(someString)\"")
    case let (x, y) as (Double, Double):
        print("an (x, y) point at \(x), \(y)")
    case let movie as Movie:
        print("a movie called '\(movie.name)', dir. \(movie.director)")
    default:
        print("something else")
    }
}
//  The cases of a switch statement use the forced version of the type cast operator (as, not as?) to check and cast to a specific type. This check is always safe within the context of a switch case statement.
