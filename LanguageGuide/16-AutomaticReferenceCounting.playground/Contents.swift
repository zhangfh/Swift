//  Unfortunately, linking these two instances creates a strong reference cycle between them. The Person instance now has a strong reference to the Apartment instance, and the Apartment instance has a strong reference to the Person instance. Therefore, when you break the strong references held by the john and number73 variables, the reference counts do not drop to zero, and the instances are not deallocated by ARC:

john = nil
unit4A = nil
// We have now leaked memory

// Resolving Strong Reference Cycles between Class Instances
//  Use a weak reference whenever it is valid for that reference to become nil at some point during its lifetime. Conversely, use an unowned reference when you know that the reference will never be nil once it has been set during initialization.

// Unowned References and Implicitly Unwrapped Optional Properties
//  Both properties should always have a value, and neither property should ever be nil once initialization is complete. This enables both properties to be accessed directly (without optional unwrapping) once initialization is complete, while still avoiding a reference cycle.

    let name: String
